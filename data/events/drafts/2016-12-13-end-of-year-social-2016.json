    "description": "<p>We're finishing off 2016 as we have done for the last couple of years and that's with a social.<\/p> <p>The evening will be taking place in a pub - we're just waiting for final confirmation and then we'll announce which one. We'll be putting on a buffet and there will be a drink or two on us for you too.<\/p> <p>Rather than a full PHPub Quiz as we have done for the last couple of years, we're currently putting together a mix of smaller bits of entertainment for the evening (possibly including a small quiz...), but want to give plenty of time for chatting and socialising too.<\/p> <p>There will, of course, be plenty of prizes! What more could you ask for!<\/p> <p><b>Note:<\/b> Unfortunately we have had to hold this on the <b>second Tuesday <\/b>rather than the Wednesday. It wasn't a decision we took lightly, but gave us the best option for venues.<\/p> <p>--<\/p> <p>As always, a big thanks to our meetup sponsors\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ents24.com\/\">Ents24<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.brightpearl.com\/\">Brightpearl<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.meanbee.com\/\">Meanbee<\/a>\u00a0&amp; <a href=\"http:\/\/deepbluesky.com\/\">Deep Blue Sky<\/a> without whom we wouldn't be able to put on events the likes of which we have this year.\u00a0<\/p> <p>--<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/phpsw.uk\/events\/227016878-phpub-quiz-2015\">View on the PHPSW website<\/a><\/p> ",
