    "description": "<p><i>Twas a few weeks before Christmas, when all through Bristol<br\/>Not a creature was stirring, not even an ElePHPant.<\/i><\/p> <p>In a PHPSW tradition, we're finishing up the year with a social, rather than a normal evening of talks.<\/p> <p>This year we'll be hosting it upstairs at the Famous Royal Navy Volunteer. We'll be providing a couple of drinks for everyone and a small buffet.<\/p> <p>As well as plenty of time for chatting and socialising, we'll be organising a few activities (possibly including the return of JeoPHPardy) and giving away plenty of prizes too.<\/p> <p>--<\/p> <p>As always, a big thanks to our meetup sponsors\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ents24.com\/\">Ents24<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.brightpearl.com\/\">Brightpearl<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.meanbee.com\/\">Meanbee<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/deepbluesky.com\/\">Deep Blue Sky<\/a>\u00a0&amp; <a href=\"https:\/\/equiniticybersecurity.com\/careers\/\">Equiniti<\/a> without whom we wouldn't be able to put on events the likes of which we have this year.\u00a0<\/p> ",
