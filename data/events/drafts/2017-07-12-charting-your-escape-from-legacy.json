    "description": "<p>In June we've got a couple of different talks - one about Graphs and one about Legacy code. Unfortunately our snappy title &amp; theming department are on holiday this month...<\/p> <p>Thanks to Brightpearl for kindly hosting us this month.<\/p> <p>Our talks this month:<\/p> <p><b>-\u00a0Graphs are Everywhere<br\/><\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/choult\">Chris Hoult<\/a>,\u00a0senior software engineer, speaker, phpberks founder &amp; fount of useless knowledge.<\/p> <p>No - not charts! Graphs are a data structure that are more than just the nodes and edges they contain: from mapping networks to representing arithmetic, from writing chat-bots to inferring relationships, applying graphs to a problem can quite often provide an elegant solution. In this light-hearted and accessible talk, Chris will cover the basics of graphs as well as go over a few simple but fun examples of this versatile concept.<\/p> <p><b>-\u00a0Living With Legacy<br\/><\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MPOram\">&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.meetup.com\/php-sw\/members\/101607952\/\"&gt;Nigel Dunn<\/a>, Software Engineer, <a href=\"https:\/\/oncorps.io\/\">OnCorps<\/a>.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/maydenacademy.co.uk\/\">&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.instantiate.co.uk\/\"&gt;<\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\n--<\/p> <p><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.brightpearl.com\/\">Brightpearl<\/a> have kindly offered to host the evening at their office, and as always we'll sort out some ales, lagers, soft drinks and snacks.
